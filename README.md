# 🎲 Tenzies Game | React + Vite

A simple yet addictive dice game built with **React** and **Vite**. Players roll dice until all show the same number—locking selected dice between rolls to strategize toward victory.

Built to explore component architecture, state management, and fast-refresh development using Vite.

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://tenziesgamealpha.netlify.app/
